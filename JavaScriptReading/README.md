### Things I already knew
Ch.1 Boolean type has just two values which is true and false
Ch.2 In terms of binding names, the standard JavaScript functions follow the final style which is capitalizing every word except the first. 
Ch.3 writing similar code multiple times is not a good way since there are more space for mistakes

### Things I didn’t know before
Ch.1 Inside the computer, bits take forms such as a high or low electrical charge, a strong or weak signal, or a shiny or dull spot on the surface of a CD. 
Ch.2 The break statement has the effect of immediately jumping out of the enclosing loop as same as ‘false’ statement
Ch.3 Using function keyword at the start of a statement is a slightly shorter way to create a function binding
